## 🌟 About The Project

This project demonstrates what happens when you treat **[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)** less like a pure data science dashboarding framework and more like a canvas for modern web development. 

The goal was to build a personal portfolio that feels responsive, highly premium, and breaks away from generic "AI-generated" templates. By overriding Streamlit's native DOM using deep CSS injections, inline SVG components, and JavaScript-powered scroll listeners, this app achieves an aesthetic previously thought impossible in a basic Python script.

### 🌐 Live Application
The project is officially deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud.  
**You can check it out here:** [https://act02-appmultipageap.streamlit.app/](https://act02-appmultipageap.streamlit.app/)

## ✨ Features & Architecture

### 💎 Custom UI System (`ui.py`)
At the core of the project relies a centralized design engine `ui.py` which strips default UI bloat and enforces a rigorous design system:
- **Glassmorphism Components:** Sleek, translucent `.glass-card` elements with active `backdrop-filter: blur()`, drop shadows, and animated accent-bar hover reveals.
- **Organic "Living" Backgrounds:** Floating, animated CSS blob keyframes interacting with a subtle custom SVG dot-grid background. 
- **100% SVG Iconography:** Eliminating emojis across the board in favor of a custom 30+ library of crisp, scalable inline vector icons (Lucide-inspired).
- **Modern Typography:** Globally forced `@import` of the *Inter* font family for seamless legibility.

### 🎭 Interactions & Animations
- **Scroll Reveals:** Intersection Observers trigger smooth `<div class="reveal">` slide-ups on native DOM elements as you scroll down pages.
- **Session-Guarded Typing Hero:** A CSS-native step animation typing out `"Hi, I'm Rena"`. This runs *only* once per browser session via `st.session_state` checks to ensure UX isn't ruined by constant re-runs.
- **Dynamic Skill Bars:** Custom keyframe animations progressively fill percentage bars when navigating to the technical skills page.
- **True Theming:** Granular control over a strict palette for both Light and Dark modes. Zero cheap gradients—only solid color tokens driving the UX.
